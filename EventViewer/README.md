# EventViewer

Prototype of a general 'event viewer' for events that have unfolded on Twitter.

First use-case is the 2013 Colorado Flood.


Consists of:

+ Display 'layer' being prototypes at https://github.com/blehman/maperator
+ JSON dataset generator: pulls data from MySQL data and generates a (Geo)JSON dataset for an event.
