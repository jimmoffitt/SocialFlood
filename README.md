A collection of things related to display and analysis around the 2013 Colorado Flood.

I posted a series of blog posts that focued on two of my professional interests: early warning systems and Twitter.

The research behind these blog posts involved a variety of software tools that helped harvest both Twitter and meteorlogical data, store that data in a MySQL database, and then perform the time-series analysis presented in the posts:

Yeah, I have a strong interest in flood warning software. [This](https://www.onerain.com/solutions/diadvisor) was something I focused on for over ten years... I helped build data services that drive [this family of web-based early-warning systems](https://www.onerain.com/contrail-hydrologic-software). Those services focuses on a API for data and metadata exchange, based on a family of Java Servlets. Also developed backend Java apps that provided alarm and notification services.
